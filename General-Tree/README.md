# General Tree
This repository contains an implementation of a General Tree data structure in C++. A General Tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node 
can have an arbitrary number of child nodes. This implementation provides basic functionalities for creating, modifying, and executing operations on the tree.

## Introduction
The General Tree implementation consists of the following components:

node.h: Defines the Node class, representing a node in the tree. Each node holds a value of type Func, and maintains a list of child nodes.
general_tree.h: Defines the GeneralTree class, which encapsulates the tree structure. It provides methods for adding and deleting child nodes, as well as executing operations on the tree.
