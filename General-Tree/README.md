# General Tree
This repository contains an implementation of a General Tree data structure in C++. A General Tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node 
can have an arbitrary number of child nodes. This implementation provides basic functionalities for creating, modifying, and executing operations on the tree.

## Features
Dynamic Structure: The General Tree implementation allows nodes to have an arbitrary number of child nodes, making it suitable for representing hierarchical relationships with varying degrees of branching.

Child Manipulation: You can easily add and delete child nodes to modify the structure of the tree.

Execution of Operations: The tree supports executing operations on nodes, providing flexibility for performing custom actions on specific parts of the tree.

Flexibility: The implementation is generic, allowing you to use different data types for the node values by templating the Node class.

Ease of Use: The provided methods and functions are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, enabling straightforward creation and manipulation of the tree.
