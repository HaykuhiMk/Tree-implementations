# BST (Binary Search Tree)

BST is a C++ implementation of a binary search tree data structure. It provides functionalities to create a binary search tree, perform operations such as insertion, removal, searching, and various other utility functions. There is also the 'saveToFile' function, which is used to save the binary search tree to a file. The 'saveFromFile' function is used to read data from a file and build a binary search tree. 



# Features
