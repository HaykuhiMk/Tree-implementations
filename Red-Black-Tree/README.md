# Red-Black Tree
This repository contains an implementation of a Red-Black Tree data structure in C++. A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree with 
additional properties that ensure the tree remains balanced even after insertions and deletions.

## Features
Balanced Tree: The Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, ensuring efficient operations by maintaining a balanced structure.

Insertion and Deletion: The implementation provides methods for inserting nodes into the tree and deleting nodes from the tree while preserving the Red-Black Tree properties.

Search: You can search for specific values in the Red-Black Tree using the find method, which returns a pointer to the node if found or nullptr otherwise.

Tree Traversals: The implementation supports in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree traversals, allowing you to visit the nodes of the tree in different orders.

Copy and Move Operations: The Red-Black Tree supports copy construction, move construction, copy assignment, and move assignment operations, enabling efficient copying and moving of tree instances.
